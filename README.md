# Heart Disease UCI Dataset Project

## 📊 Overview

This project analyzes the **Heart Disease UCI** dataset, a collection of medical data from patients across multiple regions — **Cleveland**, **Hungary**, **Switzerland**, and **VA Long Beach**. The dataset includes attributes like age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, and heart disease diagnosis. 

📈 The goal is to explore patterns and extract insights using **Excel-based analysis**.

## 🗃️ Dataset

**Source**: Heart Disease UCI dataset (originally from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease))

### 🧬 Columns:

- `id`: Patient identifier  
- `age`: Age in years  
- `sex`: Male or Female  
- `dataset`: Region (e.g., Cleveland)  
- `cp`: Chest pain type (`typical angina`, `asymptomatic`, `non-anginal`, `atypical angina`)  
- `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)  
- `chol`: Cholesterol level (mg/dl)  
- `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (`TRUE`/`FALSE`)  
- `restecg`: Resting ECG results (`normal`, `lv hypertrophy`, etc.)  
- `thalch`: Maximum heart rate achieved  
- `exang`: Exercise-induced angina (`TRUE`/`FALSE`)  
- `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise  
- `slope`: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment  
- `ca`: Number of major vessels (0–3)  
- `thal`: Thalassemia result (`normal`, `fixed defect`, `reversable defect`)  
- `num`: Diagnosis of heart disease (`0` = no, `>0` = yes)

📌 **Rows**: 920 patients  
📎 **Sample provided**: 10 rows

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Analyze patient demographics and health metrics  
- Use Excel functions like `COUNT`, `AVERAGE`, `COUNTIFS`, etc. to answer:
  - Beginner questions
  - Intermediate questions
  - Advanced questions
- Identify trends in:
  - Heart disease prevalence
  - Key risk factors
  - Regional differences

## ⚙️ Setup

### ✅ Requirements

- Microsoft Excel **or** Google Sheets  
- Dataset file: `heart_disease_uci.csv`

### 📥 Installation

1. Download the `heart_disease_uci.csv` file from this repository.
2. Open it in Microsoft Excel **or** paste into Google Sheets.
3. Ensure the data is properly formatted:
   - In Google Sheets: Go to **Data > Split text to columns**
   - Select **Comma** as the delimiter
